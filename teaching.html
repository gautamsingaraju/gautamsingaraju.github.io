Teaching Assignments: </strong><br />
<br />
I have been actively involved in the design of the lab infrastructure and classes for
ITIS 3100: Introduction to IT, an 
undergraduate course which now runs into two sections in the department. The class material was 
designed as a part of the NSF grant that focuses on developing mechanisms to 
incorporate cyber games and interactive simulations into their classes. In the workshops, faculty members from different universities learn these techniques to incorporate it into their curriculum at their respective 
universities. 
For this course, I have been nominated for <strong>the outstanding TA award</strong>. I presented my teaching 
experiences about incorporating virtualization to teach system administration at System 
Education Workshop at USENIX LISA 2007. <br />
