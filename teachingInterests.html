<h3>Teaching Experience</h3>
<p>I have actively designed lab infrastructure and the lab classes for
<a href="http://isr.uncc.edu/itis3100">ITIS 3100: Introduction to IT</a>, an 
undergraduate course which now runs into two sections in the department. The 
class material that I designed is a part of an NSF grant material focused on 
that develops faculty workshops where the faculty members from different 
universities learn mechanisms to incorporate cyber games and interactive 
simulations into their classes. I have been nominated for <strong>the outstanding TA 
award</strong>. I presented my teaching experiences using virtualization to teach system 
administration at System Education Workshop at USENIX LISA 2007.</p>
